Algorithm to generate a 5x5 Puzzle:

Using a 0 index (column1[2] means the 3rd letter of column 1).
If a step fails, return to previous step, clear that row, and find another word.

Steps:
Select a word at random (A)
=> insert as row 1

Find a word that starts with the same letter as row 1 (B)
=> insert as column 1

Find a word that starts with {column1[1]} & doesn't cause bad start sequences in columns 2-5 (C)
=> insert as row 2

Find a word that starts with {row1[1],  row2[1]} & doesn't cause bad start sequences in rows 3-5 (D)
=> insert as column 2

Find a word that starts with {column1[2], column2[2]} & doesn't cause bad start sequences in columns 3-5 (E)
=> insert as row 3

Find a word that starts with {row1[2], row2[2], row3[2]} & doesn't cause bad start sequences in row 4 (F)
=> insert as column 3

Find a word that starts with {column1[3], column2[3], column3[3]} & doesn't cause bad start sequences in columns 4-5 (G)
=> insert as row 4

Find a word that starts with {row1[3], row2[3], row3[3], row4[3]} & doesn't cause bad start sequences in row 5 (H)
=> insert as column 4

Find a word that starts with {column1[4], column2[4], column3[4], column4[4]} (I)
=> insert as row 5

Find a word that starts with {row1[4], row2[5], row3[4], row4[4], row5[4]} 
=> Puzzle is finished
